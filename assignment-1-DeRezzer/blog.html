<h2>April 2nd, 2019 | Hello HTML?</h2>
<ul><p>This weeks assignment was really fun to work on. As I mentioned in the assignemnt<br>
    itself, I have zero Web Development experience and at first I was comepletely lost<br>
    on where to even start. But there are a lot of resources available online and Dr. Hess<br>
    also added a lot of resources for us to make sure we would be able to complete the simple<br>
    instructions that are required in this assignment. It's funny to me that I don't really<br>
    consider coding assignments as "school work", they're often a lot of fun and feel like I'm<br>
    I'm just messing around on my computer.
    </p>
    <p>I haven't used github in a while so I had to refresh my knowledge of it but it came pretty<br>
        pretty quick. Though it was really confusing on how to exaclty publish my pages correctly<br>
        I couldn't find my pulic_html folder for the longest time and I felt like a dummy when it was<br>
        literally under my nose (in my user directory...). It took me a second to figure out how to<br>
        get an image to to show up but then someone had a similar isssue they brought up on Piazza<br>
        that got solved. It was the same issue I was having, so it was a lot help to get that cleared<br>
        up. 
    </p>
    <p>I had some trouble setting my repo on my machine correctly. I didn't know I could clone directly<br>
       into my engr directory. The way I was doing it before was literally updating my files manually when<br>
       I made a change. I would delete/replace the old file with the new one. It was a hassle.</p></ul>
