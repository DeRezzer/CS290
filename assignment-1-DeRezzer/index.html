<h1>About me</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Martin Escoto</p>
<p><strong>Email:</strong> escotom@oregonstate.edu</p>
<p><strong>Major & Year:</strong> My major is CS and I'm a Junior at OSU</p>
<a href = "blog.html"> <p><strong>Blog</strong></p></a>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<ul><li><strong>0-10, how comfortable are you with HTML?</strong></li>
    <p>I think I'm at a solid 2. It's not super difficult<br>so far but with
      practice this will eventually<br>become easier.</p>

    <li><strong>What do you hope to learn in this class?</strong></li>
    <p>I have zero experience with Web Development<br>
      so I just hope to learn the basics well enough<br>
      to be able to proficiently create my own projects<br>
      in the future.</p>
    <li><strong>Have you signed up for Piazza?</strong></li>
    <p>Yup! Never used it before this term and now I have<br>
    two classes that are utilizing it. So far it's great.</p>
  </ul>

<h2>Interesting fact</h2>

<ul>I love to write shorts stories about science fiction.<br>
    I first read Dune by Frank Herbert a few years ago<br>
    and fell in love with the genre.<br>
    I love to read all kinds of genres including poetry<br>
    but there is something about science fiction that<br>
    bring out the best of me as a writer. As such, on top<br>
    of my CS major, I'm also pursuing a minor in writing.</ul>
